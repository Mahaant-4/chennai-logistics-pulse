🚛 Chennai Logistics Pulse: Hyperlocal Logistics Friction Engine
A Real-time Digital Twin for Urban Logistics Optimization

📖 Project Overview
Chennai Logistics Pulse is a data-driven dashboard designed to monitor and predict logistical friction points across Chennai's key industrial and IT corridors.

By integrating real-time traffic data, hyperlocal weather conditions, and static infrastructure metrics (road width, intersection density), this application creates a "Digital Twin" of the city. It allows logistics managers to identify bottlenecks, predict delivery delays, and visualize flood risks in real-time.

✨ Key Features
📍 Real-Time Traffic Integration: Fetches live flow data from 50+ strategic probes across Chennai (North Port, Central Business District, OMR IT Corridor) using the TomTom API.

🌦️ Weather Impact Analysis: Integrates live precipitation and temperature data via Open-Meteo to adjust delivery time estimates dynamically.

🤖 Predictive Analytics: Uses a Random Forest Regressor (ML) to predict transit delays based on road complexity, rain intensity, and time-of-day.

🌊 Flood Risk Detection: Identifies and highlights zones prone to waterlogging (e.g., Velachery, Adyar) during high-rainfall events.

📦 Containerized Deployment: Fully Dockerized application deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for consistent performance across environments.
